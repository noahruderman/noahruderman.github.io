                I'm a bit of a hacker (in a good way), programming just about every system and technology I can get my hands on.
                I love programming and building new things.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from computers, I enjoy hiking in nearby nature preserves and biking.
                Recently, I've been introduced to rock climbing which has gotten me hooked.
